This will not end well if the industry doesn't recognize that open source isn't about the license. The value isn't in the source code. It's about fostering a diverse collaborative community of sustainable support and continuous improvement and innovation. In his talk, Christopher, an IBM Fellow and IBM's CTO of Open Technology, will share his perspectives on the value of open governance for open source projects.",

      "abstractText": "Netflix relies on Apache Cassandra as a critical source of truth database, and while Cassandra is a remarkably resilient database, it does, ever so occasionally, break. This talk explores how complex Cassandra deployments fail in production, but more importantly, the techniques, tools, and approaches our distributed systems engineers use to debug and mitigate these failures. We will first cover software-based failure modes that come either from our software or the software that Cassandra builds upon. For example, retry storms or unbounded queues can effectively overwhelm the database. Cassandra and Linux give you many tools to detect these, and there are numerous strategies you can use to avoid them. Along the way we will also visit common JVM failure modes and how to assess and remediate these. Next, we will cover hardware-based failure modes that come from a typical cloud environment. We will cover the broad classes of drive and network failures that we cope with every day, as well as the metrics and tests we use to detect them. With these understandings, we will learn how to automatically heal these failures and safely meet our latency SLOs. Finally, we will cover systemic failure modes, including complex interactions of multiple components and systems. This will involve a number of concrete failures we observed that involved multiple bugs, system failures, or data modeling issues in combination. At the end of the talk, we hope that the audience leaves understanding how large distributed databases can fail, but also how to use DevOps skills and tools to debug, mitigate, and automate away these failure modes going forward.",

      "abstractText": "At Netflix, we manage petabytes of data in Apache Cassandra which must be reliably accessible to users in mere milliseconds. To achieve this, we have built sophisticated control planes that turn our persistence layer based on Apache Cassandra into a truly self-driving system. We will start with the user interface that Netflix developers use to interact with their Cassandra databases and dive deep into the automation that powers it all. From cluster creation, through scaling up, to cluster death, complex automation drives large fleets of virtual machines hosted on the AWS cloud. First, we will cover the basics of how Netflix deploys Apache Cassandra. In particular, this begins with how we mold Apache Cassandra to the Netflix philosophy of immutable infrastructure, including managing software and hardware upgrades in the face of ever-failing hardware. Then we will explore the concrete techniques needed for such a massive deployment, specifically pull-based control planes and auto-healing strategies. Next, we will cover how Netflix has automated complex but critical Apache Cassandra maintenance tasks such as continuous snapshot backups and always-on anti-entropy repair for keeping our datasets safe and consistent. Both of these systems have gone through multiple architectural evolutions, and we have learned many lessons along the way. Lastly, we will share some of the ways this has gone wrong, and what you can do to avoid them. We will cover a few case studies of major Cassandra outages at Netflix, their root cause, and what we learned from those incidents. At the end of this talk, we hope that participants leave with concrete understanding of the challenges in running massive scale Apache Cassandra as well as solid advice and techniques for building their own self-driving data persistence layer.",

      "title": "Next Generation Cassandra Compaction, Going beyond LCS",
      "abstractText": "Cassandra users with general purpose workloads typically must choose the lesser of two evils between the default “write optimized”  Size Tiered Compaction Strategy (STCS) and the “read optimized” Leveled Compaction Strategy (LCS). It is typical these days to hear “use LCS unless it explodes, in which case use STCS…unless that explodes, in which case you are out of luck”. I believe that by taking what we as a community learned from the development and real world deployment of LCS, we can create a next generation compaction strategy which offers all of the benefits of LCS with few of the drawbacks. I will begin this talk with an overview of the existing general purpose options, and explore their deficiencies. In particular, we will explore how STCS naïvely groups SSTables of similar size together regardless of read amplification, expends system resources compacting data that does not benefit from compaction, and creates large files that are difficult to process both by Cassandra and downstream systems. The LCS compaction algorithm was developed to mitigate many of these issues. However, LCS suffers from issues of its own: implementation bugs caused by the complexity of the algorithm, significant write amplification introduced in the L0 to L1 transition, and a lack of efficient full compaction. LCS is a worthwhile compaction strategy, but these flaws prevent it from being applied universally to general purpose workloads. Once we have a firm understanding of the issues facing current implementations, I will present a number of potential incremental improvements to the existing choices. I’ll also synthesize these ideas into a blueprint for a new, general purpose, compaction strategy.  A key design consideration is to offer users a single compaction interface with easy to understand tunables that adapt to all use cases historically covered by either STCS or LCS. Once I have laid out the proposal, I will open the topic for feedback from other developers in the room and I hope that at the end we will have built consensus around the key challenges of Cassandra compaction, as well as come to a decision on the best path forward.",

Relying on Apache OpenNLP and its sub-project OpenNLP.chatbot, we introduce a number of tools and components to design a chatbot and its training set to be knowledgeable and intelligent.  n   In this talk we will analyze the reasons it is so hard to find a chatbot demo today for a nontrivial task or to observe an intelligent behavior of a chatbot.  It is easy to see how a success in AI can boost the chatbot development on one hand, but it is hard to detect intelligence in those chatbots that are available to the public, on the other hand. n   We will present an advanced search engine for chatbots with the focus on linguistic features and discourse-level analysis for dialogue management. We will introduce a tool that builds a dialogue from an arbitrary document to form a training dataset for deep learning chatbots. We will demo a chatbot supporting virtual dialogue, where a user joins a virtual community built on the fly, whose members answer questions in this user's current area of interest. An extended content for this talk is available in the book recently published by the speaker “Developing Enterprise Chatbots”.",

      "abstractText": "he business value of data decreases rapidly after it is created, particularly in use cases such as fraud prevention, cybersecurity, and real-time system monitoring. The high-volume, high-velocity datasets used to feed these use cases often contain valuable, but perishable, insights that must be acted upon immediately. In order to maximize the value of their data enterprises must fundamentally change their approach to processing real-time data to focusing reducing their decision latency on the perishable insights that exist within their real-time data streams. Thereby enabling the organization to act upon them while the window of opportunity is open. Generating timely insights in a high-volume, high-velocity data environment is challenging for a multitude of reasons. As the volume of data increases, so does the amount of time required to transmit it back to the datacenter and process it. Secondly, as the velocity of the data increases, the faster the data and the insights derived from it lose value. In this talk, we will present a solution based on Apache Pulsar Functions that significantly reduces decision latency by using probabilistic algorithms to perform analytic calculations on the edge.",

Through the last year it went a bit silent around the project and although the topic is hotter than ever the project lost its drive and went into hibernation. With the rise of other projects in the (industrial) IoT ecosystem like Apache PLC4X and Apache IoTDB there are a lot of new use cases and applications for edge processing, especially in the field of industrial IoT thus, a group of contributors from other IoT related projects has gathered to bring the project back to life and on track.nIn this talk, an introduction into Apache Edgent is given. Its past, its current state and plans on how the project could evolve in the near future.nProjects like Apache PLC4X (incubating) allow us to gather massive amounts of data from machines and plants and close the gap between the `Shopfloor`and the Big Data ecosystem. But, there are a few important differences between `classical` stream processing and the processing of industrial data streams. As the `classical` Big Data world is all about (vertical) scaling and parallelism this is not necessarily true for industrial data. Furthermore, many industrial sides are connected with low bandwidths which makes it even more difficult to send all the data to the cloud. Apache Edgent tries to address these issues by providing a platform for Edge processing.",

The plug-in enables developers to quickly reap the benefits of secure LDAP authentication without the need to write their own solutions, and to transition to using the authenticator with zero downtime. - A Kerberos authenticator plug-in for CassandranThe open source Kerberos authenticator plug-in enables Cassandra users to leverage Kerberos’ industry-leading secure authentication and true single sign-on capabilities. The open source project also includes a Kerberos authenticator plugin for the Cassandra Java driver. - Cassandra Prometheus ExporternThe cassandra-exporter is a high-performance metrics collection agent that allows for easy integration with the Prometheus monitoring solution. It has been designed to collect detailed metrics on production-sized clusters with complex schemata with minimal performance impact while at the same time following Prometheus's best practices for exporting metrics. - Additional utilities and debugging toolsnIncluding a utility to assist with backup and restore to various cloud providers, and tools to provide debug-level information about SSTables. - A Cassandra operator for running and operating Cassandra within KubernetesnThe open source Cassandra operator functions as a Cassandra-as-a-Service on Kubernetes, fully handling deployment and operations duties so that developers don’t have to. It also offers a consistent environment and set of operations founded on best practices, which is reproducible across production clusters and development, staging, and QA environments. The audience for this presentation will learn the specifics of how to implement – and get the most out of – these open source solutions.",

      "abstractText": "As distributed applications grow more complex, dynamic, and massively scalable, “observability” becomes more critical. Observability is the practice of using metrics, monitoring and distributed tracing to understand how a system works. In this presentation we’ll explore two complementary Open Source technologies: Prometheus for monitoring application metrics; and OpenTracing and Jaeger for distributed tracing. We’ll discover how they improve the observability of a massively scalable Anomaly Detection system - an application which is built around Apache Cassandra and Apache Kafka for the data layers, and dynamically deployed and scaled on Kubernetes, a container orchestration technology. We will give an overview of Prometheus and OpenTracing/Jaeger, explain how the application is instrumented, and describe how Prometheus and OpenTracing are deployed and configured in a production environment running Kubernetes, to dynamically monitor the application at scale. We conclude by exploring the benefits of monitoring and tracing technologies for understanding, debugging and tuning complex dynamic distributed systems built on Kafka, Cassandra and Kubernetes. ",

      "title": "Introducing Secure Boot in Apache CloudStack",
      "abstractText": "nExisting CloudStack supports legacy boot loader BIOS by default for Guest VM’s booting on Hypervisor(XEN, VMware, KVM etc). In Virtualization, hypervisor emulates the hardware for the Guest VM.  BIOS {Basic Input-Output system} is a low-level software. The BIOS loads when a VM starts up, and the BIOS is responsible for waking up your VM’s hardware(emulated) components, ensures they are functioning properly, and then runs the boot loader that boots Windows or whatever other operating system have installed. The existing BIOS has serious limitations. It can only boot from drives of two 1 TB or less. 3 TB drives are now common, and a computer with a BIOS can’t boot from them. That limitation is due to the way the BIOS’s Master Boot Record system works. BIOS can be used in devices that do not require large storage or security. UEFI { Unified Extensible Firmware Interface} can work alongside BIOS. It can sit on top of BIOS and work independently. Benefits of UEFI boot mode over Legacy BIOS boot mode include: Support for hard drive partitions larger than 2 TBn Support for more than four partitions on a driven Fast bootingn Efficient power and system managementn Robust reliability and fault management",

These problems are historic, chronic, and pervasive; they’ve been with us for decades, and changes to methodology haven’t had much effect in remedying them. By contrast, the Apache Software Foundation has been around for 20 years and the Apache Way - the framework of values and governance for Apache Software Foundation projects - has been the guiding force for dozens of highly successful software projects that are used in countless environments everywhere, run much of the Internet, and are probably used by every technical person in one way or another every day. In fact it would be hard to find any other software organization, open or proprietary, with a better track record. What if the Apache Way were applied to all software projects?

      "title": "Apache Training, How it came to be and what it is about",
      "abstractText": "There are lots of companies offering training for, and around, the Apache ecosystem, as well as many other topics that all create their own training material. Keeping this material up to date, especially in the fast-moving open-source world is not an easy task and takes a lot of time and effort. And all the time someone not too far away is probably working on a very similar slide-deck to explain what ZooKeeper does... It is this fundamental issue that the Apache Training project was created to address - centralising training resources and making them easier to access and (re-)use. We believe that training material, while important, is only part of what constitutes good training. The larger part is an experienced trainer who actually understands how the key aspects can be applied in real life and also the consequences of not implementing things correctly.nGreat training tends to come from the experiences and stories that a trainer can share in addition to the actual material. Based on this underlying belief and the very real pain of updating training material the Apache Training project was born. In early 2019, it entered Apache Incubator and is already building a community and gaining various contributions.  In this talk, we want to share with you some of the events and the thought process that went into the creation of this project, as well as our main goals and principles. The first part of this talk will focus on how we arrived at the decision that open-source training material is a good thing to have and a little bit of the early history of this project. In the second part, we will discuss what the project is actually about. We will demonstrate the version-control friendly system of designing slides in source control that is at the core of this project. On top of these source files, we aim to create a metadata repository which will enable everybody to efficiently search available content and easily create tailored decks from existing material. And last but very much not least, we will cover how you can contribute to and benefit from this project, as this is front and center an effort from the community for the community!",

      "title": "Apache Hadoop 3.x State of The Union and Upgrade Guidance",
      "abstractText": "'Apache Hadoop YARN is the modern Distributed Operating System for big data applications. It morphed the Hadoop compute layer to be a common resource-management platform that can host a wide variety of applications. Many organizations leverage YARN in building their applications on top of Hadoop without themselves repeatedly worrying about resource management, isolation, multi-tenancy issues etc. The Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is the primary data storage system used by Hadoop applications. It employs a NameNode and DataNode architecture to implement a distributed file system that provides high-performance access to data across highly scalable Hadoop clusters. In this talk, we’ll start with the current status of Apache Hadoop 3.x – how it is used today in deployments large and small. We’ll then move on to the exciting present & future of Hadoop 3.x – features that are further strengthening Hadoop as the primary resource-management platform as well as the storage system for enterprise data-centers. We’ll discuss the current status as well as the future promise of features and initiatives for both YARN and HDFS of Hadoop 3.x: For YARN 3.x, we have powerful container placement, global scheduling, support for machine learning (Spark) and deep learning (TensorFlow) workloads through GPU & FPGA scheduling and isolation support, extreme scale with YARN federation, containerized apps on YARN, support for long-running services (alongside applications) natively without any changes, seamless application/services upgrades, powerful scheduling features like application priorities, intra-queue preemption across applications and operational enhancements including insights through Timeline Service V2, a new web UI, better queue management, etc.nAlso, HDFS 3.0 announced GA for erasure coding which doubles the storage efficiency of data and thus reduces the cost of storage for enterprise use cases. HDFS added support for multiple standby NameNodes for better availability. For better reliability of metadata and easier operations, Journal nodes have been enhanced to sync the edit log segments to protect against rolling failures.nDisk balancing within a DataNode was another important feature added to ensure disks are evenly utilized in a DataNode, which also ensures better aggregate throughput, and prevents from lopsided utilization if new disks are added or replaced in a DataNode. HDFS team is currently driving the Ozone initiative which lays the foundation of the next generation of storage architecture for HDFS where data blocks are organized in Storage Containers for higher scale and handling of small objects in HDFS. Ozone project also includes an object store implementation to support new use cases. At last, since more and more users are planning to upgrade from 2.x to 3.x to get all the benefits mentioned above, we will also briefly talk about upgrade guidance from Hadoop 2.x to 3.×.n'",

      "abstractText": "'Apache Drill has some very surprising characteristics and, more importantly, it enables Drill users to do some surprising things. It’s no longer surprising to be able to do standard SQL in a highly distributed and large scale system - there is an entire class of modern tools that do this including Apache Hive, Presto or Spark SQL. But Drill has other capabilities that are surprising and make it stand apart from its class.  For one thing, Drill provides an extraordinary degree of flexibility in several ways, including: Support for a wide variety of file formats including semi-structured and nested data (such as Parquet, JSON, Avro) and non-file data sources - not just data access but ability to fully use these data sources with high performance Schema discovery - a capability that opens up data exploration in unexpected ways for Drill users and allows progressive data modelling Easy extensibility with high performance - you don’t have to trade one for the other These are valuable if surprising capabilities. Why, then, is that a challenge? Because people don’t expect them, they also may not come looking for a tool that can do these things. The challenge comes in how to make potential users aware of the opportunities that Drill offers. This talk will explore some of Drill’s surprising capabilities, how it’s able to do these things and what impact that has for Drill users. In addition, we will open a discussion about how best to inform and engage a broader user community. This latter issue is not only important for Drill but for other Apache projects as well.'",

      "abstractText": "Cloud database offerings have expanded over the past decade, encompassing everything from virtualized machines in the cloud to entirely serverless databases. With this pace of innovation in the cloud ecosystem, Cassandra stands in a unique position to serve its users with unique advantages over any other system. This also puts Cassandra in an interesting position to compete with the ongoing innovations in the cloud.  With the internal architecture and storage mechanism aside, citizen developers in the community are looking for several other operability aspects/ ecosystem around the services for the long term investments and benefits from such service. At this juncture, it is vital for the Cassandra dev community to build muscle around supporting such an ecosystem that the community is looking for, to be on par with rest of cloud services and other competing offers in the industry. Specifically, it is important for us to innovate and focus on improving these areas along with the rest of the product. - Ease of use n- Simplified operability in the cloud, precisely simplified operability in the hybrid/multi-cloudn- Pluggability with other infrastructure services such as metrics, discovery, and monitoringn- Painless rollouts of version and protocol upgradesn- Elegant developer experience in polyglot environmentsn- Dev education of Cassandra best practicesn- Unified access across the complex systems As Cassandra stands today, operating the database requires either considerable labor, complex automation, or both. Some of this complexity is an unavoidable result of operating a distributed system, but much of it is operational complexity stemming from properties of C* itself. As a result of these complexities, C* operators spend too much time dealing with issues that the database should solve on its own, and are unable to reap the full benefit of Cassandra’s powerful distributed data model. As part of this talk, we will focus on how to address the aforementioned challenges to keep the Cassandra competitive within the cloud offerings and database services industry, with simplified operability and elegant developer and operator experience.  We also hope to get Apache Cassandra 4.0 up and running in any cloud without a hassle with the help of the sidecar. We hope to leave a thought in the Cassandra dev community to start thinking about these areas in upcoming releases of Cassandra. ",

      "abstractText": "The Apache TinkerPop team is working on the next major version of the project -- TinkerPop4. TinkerPop4 advances the technology developed in TinkerPop3 with a new virtual machine architecture that enables any query language to control any processing engine manipulating any data structure. A query language can support a compiler to TinkerPop4's Turing Complete bytecode specification. Compiled bytecode is then translated into an intermediate functional representation that an integrated processing engine will ultimately transform into a processor-specific execution plan. TinkerPop4's intermediate representation naturally supports pull-based, push-based, distributed, message passing, threaded, query routing, etc. semantics which are captured in various data processors such as Pipes, Rx, Akka, Flink, Apex, Spark, and more. Additionally, a subset of the instructions in TinkerPop's bytecode specification denote manipulations to data stored in graph databases, relational databases, document databases, in-memory, and other data structure systems. In this way, TinkerPop4 enables system-agnostic universal computing across the numerous Apache (and other) language, processor, and database projects. This presentation offers an in-depth, technical analysis of the TinkerPop4 virtual machine architecture.",

In Uber, we use H3 (a hexagonal hierarchical geospatial indexing system) to partition the data geospatially. To incorporate both geospatial and temporal features into the forecasting models in real time, we need efficient and scalable techniques for data processing. In this presentation, we provide an overview of geospatial and temporal forecasting problem in Uber Marketplace Forecasting. Then, we use real time forecasting as an example to show the need for efficient data smoothing and describe a hexagon convolution based approach for processing H3 data in production. We will demonstrate how we could incorporate hexagon convolution with Apache Flink to scale the data smooth for forecasting.",

In this talk, we will outline the progress made in Apache community for adding fine-grained column level encryption natively into ORC format that will also provide capabilities to mask or redact data on write while protecting sensitive column metadata such as statistics to avoid information leakage. The column encryption capabilities will be fully compatible with Hadoop Key Management Server (KMS) and use the KMS to manage master keys providing the additional flexibility to use and manage keys per column centrally.

      "abstractText": "Text extraction tools are essential for obtaining the textual content and metadata of computer files for use in a wide variety of applications, including search and natural language processing tools. Techniques and tools for evaluating text extraction tools are largely missing from academia and industry. This talk will focus on recent improvements to Apache Tika's tika-eval module to help integrators evaluate content extraction at scale.  The tika-eval module was initially developed for a single batch mode on a single vm.  In recent months, however, Apache Tika has refactored this module to allow for easier scaling within Apache Solr and other large scale processing frameworks.  This talk will offer an overview of the techniques used to identify potential extraction problems -- including garbled text without ground truth; and the talk will show how the tika-eval module can be used at scale to identify potential problems with content extraction.

      "abstractText": "This session will re-evaluate Cassandra’s relationship with runtime and build systems, pointing out ways that the existing systems fall down, and identifying avenues for improvement. Over the past few years, a number of platforms have emerged for running user code. Container runtimes like Docker, container orchestrators such as Kubernetes, and metrics collections agents like Prometheus and Spectator have all gained popularity and mind-share. Cassandra functionality such as metrics, bootstrapping, and monitoring integrates with the newer paradigms, but in an ad-hoc and improvised fashion. By taking a purposeful approach to integrating with these new methods of deployment, the Cassandra community can more fully benefit from their advertised strengths. The Cassandra build system based on Ant+Ivy dates to the early 2000’s, and reflects legacy complexity that could be avoided with modern build systems. Cassandra’s system package builds are not much better and often fail to integrate with industry standards such as systemd. Iterating on the existing systems is difficult, but this technical debt slows innovation in our build systems. In this talk, we propose solutions to make building, deploying and monitoring Cassandra easy and low overhead, while taking advantage of cloud advancements wherever possible.",

      "abstractText": "In many application domains such as manufacturing, the integration and continuous processing of real-time sensor data from the Internet of Things (IoT) is crucial to continuously monitor and detect upcoming situations. While continuous processing of events in scalable architectures is already well supported by the existing Big Data tool landscape, building such applications requires technical effort and programming skills, which is often not present in manufacturing companies. To solve this problem, we have developed StreamPipes (https://www.streampipes.org), which aims at simplifying IoT data analytics for domain experts. Originating from a research project, StreamPipes has been publicly released under the Apache License in early 2018. At its core, StreamPipes provides non-technical users with an easy and intuitive way to create stream processing pipelines through a graphical editor. Pipelines consist of reusable pipeline elements, each of them implemented as a microservice using a wrapper for a specific Big Data technology (e.g., Apache Flink, Kafka Streams or lightweight runtimes that can run directly at the edge). We motivate our talk by showing examples we gathered from a number of industry projects during the past years in Industrial IoT domains, present technical details of StreamPipes and show how the tool eases the accessibility of Big Data tools for non-technical users.",

      "abstractText": "With the expansion of moving legacy applications into public clouds, there have been an increased need for features in proxies to inject security into legacy application deployments.  In this talk, we present extensions made to the Apache Traffic Server proxy over the past two years to enable the secure deployment of legacy applications in a wider variety of network configurations.  Specifically, we discuss how Traffic Sever can be used for Layer 4 Routing.  In this case, the router does not terminate the TLS connection, but rather use the Server Name Indicator (SNI) to determine were the TLS connection should actually be terminated.  Traffic Server configuration additions were also made to allow for the finer-grained deployment of mutual TLS authentication both between the user agent and Traffic Server and between Traffic Server and the origin.  A new TLS Bridge plugin allows for the injection of a proxy-to-proxy TLS tunnels to support older applications securely communicating between organizations (e.g. between public cloud and on premise cloud).  While we have specifically been working with Traffic Server, our development and production deployment experiences for moving applications into new cross-cloud configurations apply to the problem space in general.",

The main issue with optimally reading on-disk data is that a single partition data most of the time needs to be fetched from multiple partitions. None of the existing compaction strategies are optimized to provide a single file read guarantees on cold data. Partition based compaction strategy addresses that issue with effectively compacting all data that belongs to a single partition into the same SSTable. In this presentation, we will talk about proposed implementation details for such compaction strategy and a couple of solutions addressing the issues like write amplification and higher disk io requirements compared to default size tiered compaction.",

CassKop works as a usual K8S controller (reconcile the real state with a desired state) and automates the Cassandra operations through JMX. All the operations are launched by calling standard K8S APIs (kubectl apply …) or by using a K8S plugin (kubectl casskop …). CassKop is developed in GO, based on CoreOS operator-sdk framework.nAmong the main features :n- deploying a rack aware cluster (or AZ aware cluster)n- scaling up & down (including cleanups)n- setting and modifying configuration parameters (C* and JVM parameters)n- adding / removing a datacenter in Cassandran- rebuilding nodesn- removing node or replacing node (in case of hardware failure)n- upgrading C* or Java versions (including upgradesstables)n- monitoring (using Prometheus/Grafana)n- ... By using local and persistent volumes, it is possible to handle failures or stop/start nodes for maintenance operations with no transfer of data between nodes. Moreover, cassandra-reaper is deployed in K8S and used for scheduling repair sessions (Thanks to Spotify and TheLastPickle teams)nThe Cassandra exporter for Prometheus and backup/restore developed by Instaclustr are also used (Thanks to Instaclustr team) During this session, we will delve into the architecture and implementation of this operator, and share our learnings.",

      "abstractText": "DESCRIPTION: Today's Nordstrom customers expect order fulfillment options shipping to the most convenient locations in the timeframes that best fit their schedules.  This session offers an inside look at how Nordstrom's Supply Chain Technology team combined an extensive network of brick and mortar facilities with a custom software stack built atop JanusGraph to present fulfillment options tailored to each individual order. ABSTRACT: Over the last decade, the volume of online retail sales as a proportion of overall retail sales has nearly tripled, and there are no signs of this trend slowing down.  In a $500 billion online retail market driven by ever more savvy online shoppers, expectations for order fulfillment have grown more demanding. Consumers expect a choice of fulfillment options that offer convenience, flexibility and value.  Nordstrom's Supply Chain Technology team is charged with meeting those customer expectations through efficient distribution of millions of unique items from a cross-country network of brick and mortar facilities. For the engineers on our team, it made perfect sense to use JanusGraph to model a dynamic inventory picture managed by a diverse set of geographically distributed facilities. Despite our enthusiasm, not everyone was eager to adopt an unfamiliar open source graph system. In this presentation, Jeff Callahan will discuss why his team at Nordstrom embraced JanusGraph as the backbone of a new data pipeline built to meet the evolving expectations of customers today (and tomorrow, too).  After taking a detailed look at the system architecture, we'll also discuss some of the internal organizational challenges we faced in adopting JanusGraph, and how we managed to navigate those challenges to ultimately deliver an even stronger solution. NOTE: While this presentation focuses on JanusGraph, there is considerable overlap with Big Data, Machine Learning and Cassandra",

Historically, programming languages concentrated on single machine execution, in a controlled environment, and also for good reason, because any other external interactions were out of the scope of a programming language, at least in the bygone days that is. But now, the communication network is something that is always there, and software often doesn't work alone. But rather, they work more and more by communicating with each other to do something meaningful. So hiding this network from our code is no longer an option, and we try to use various frameworks and libraries get the functionality we need. Ballerina is a general purpose programming language, which has built its core concepts and functionalities to support creation of networked application. These features include the built-in support for services/resources, transactions, and resilient communication support, and also combines with a type system which further enhances these operations. In this session, we will go through Ballerina, in understanding the motivation behind this language, the features it introduces, and why it is a critical and a timely addition to the tools and technologies we would need now.",

For all practical purposes, a user of S3 can start using Ozone without any change to code or tools. S3 protocol support offered by Ozone is strongly consistent, so users don’t need to run sidekick tools like S3Guard when running big data applications like Apache Spark, Apache YARN or Apache Hive. This talk is a deep dive into how Ozone supports S3, and how easy it is to use the cloud tools against Ozone. We will demo S3 over Ozone with different off-the-shelf tools like Goofys, Kubernetes CSI, AWS CLI and also demonstrate how to use applications like Apache Spark, Apache Hive and YARN. We will also discuss some of the challenges faced during building S3 compatible rest server. For example, how we did the mapping of  S3 semantics to ozone semantics, how we solved the S3 security issues and mapped them to ozone world. With S3 support Ozone has become a generic object store: it can be used with thousands of s3 compatible tools while it will also provide Hadoop compatible file system access.",

When considering Apache Cassandra for one’s database needs, it is critical for users to understand when it is appropriate for use, and what are the trade-off’s one needs to consider. A person must consider the priorities of their non-functional requirements, the required investment in knowledge acquisition, the increased complexity of distributed systems, and the operational needs of maintaining such a database system among other concerns.

In fact, diversity in open source is significantly worse than in proprietary software. While we claim that contribution is open to all, clearly not everybody feels empowered or welcome to contribute to open source projects. And that's a problem. How can we fix this? How can we enable all developers everywhere to contribute to open source and take advantage of the opportunities it presents? In Q1 2019, Google's Open Source Strategy team commissioned a user research study to better understand why users do (or do not) contribute back to the project, and how documentation can help remove roadblocks to that project's adoption and usage - and encourage and enable community contributions. In this talk, we'll cover the methodology and participant profiles of the study, and describe the four essential user personas we identified - along with their critical user-to-contributor journeys. And we'll also distill the research to provide concrete recommendations and best practices for creating documentation that helps your community flourish and your project thrive.",

MiNiFi is a lightweight application which can be deployed on hardware orders of magnitude smaller and less powerful than the existing standard data collection platforms. With both a JVM compatible and native agent, MiNiFi allows data collection in brand new environments — sensors with tiny footprints, distributed systems with intermittent or restricted bandwidth, and even disposable or ephemeral hardware. Not only can this data be prioritized and have some initial analysis performed at the edge, it can be encrypted and secured immediately. Local governance and regulatory policies can be applied across geopolitical boundaries to conform with legal requirements. And all of this configuration can be done from central command & control using an existing NiFi with the trusted and stable UI data flow managers already love.    ",

From a feature-based modelling, where NLP tasks are tackled by using a set of manually engineered features, we moved to the so-called representation learning: text is naturally represented as a sequence of symbols (e.g., words, characters, etc.) and the role of learning how these symbols should be represented is entirely left to the ML method. Deep Learning dominates such paradigmatic shift.nIn this presentation we will review the Deep Learning approach to NLP and discuss different alternatives for representing text, including word embeddings[1] and character embeddings[2].nFinally, we will focus on the latest advances, including: ELMo[3], a model for generating deep contextualized word embeddings, and BERT[4], a very recent Neural Network Model that allows to achieve state-of-the-art results on several NLP tasks with very little task-specific fine-tuning.nThis presentation will mix scientific theory and actual code examples from Apache MXNet (incubating) demonstrating how to leverage these advanced techniques to solve NLP tasks.

      "abstractText": "Industrial IoT platforms are undergoing rapid shift away from vertically integrated systems built mostly out of embedded software towards an Edge Virtualization Platforms and commodity, cloud native software.  While the cloud, big-data, fast-data, machine-learning has been a huge thing in the IT industry for the last years, the production industry was stuck in a proprietary world, dominated by some of the big players. Two open source projects now offer the building blocks for the new platform that can hope to break that proprietary chokehold. Linux Foundation's Project EVE (Edge Virtualization Engine) aims to develop an open and standardized edge container runtime platform capable of orchestrating cloud-native applications across the enterprise, on-premises edge and IoT deployments. It does so by leveraging hardware-assisted virtualization and provides software defined networking and I/O virtualization capabilities to the end user applications running on it. We use EVE as a runtime for the new Apache PLC4X project that in turn provides a unified API for communicating with industrial controllers via a wide variety of protocols. Besides providing the APIs and driver implementations, PLC4X also provides integration modules to other Apache frameworks such as Apache Edgent, Apache Camel and Apache Kafka that are also supported by the unified EVE IoT edge container runtime. This makes it really easy to integrate industrial controllers into our Open-Source world. Self-optimizing production processes, predictive maintenance, industrial control systems running in the companies cloud. This was all almost impossible until now. With Apache PLC4X and LF Edge EVE it will be easy.",

      "title": "Schema-Controlled HDFS Column Encryption and Use Cases",
      "abstractText": "Motivation: Access control via encryption improves security coverage compared with traditional enforcement in the access path because encryption can prevent invalid accesses from any angle.   Finer-grained access control at the column-level is needed because in a typical big dataset, only a few columns are sensitive and need to be protected, and different columns could have different sensitivities and a different set of eligible readers.  Design: With encryption features in columnar file format like Apache Parquet, column access control via encryption becomes possible. But to adopt these features into existing analytic frameworks that might use Apache Hive, Apache Spark, Apache Preto etc, is a challenge because significant changes are needed to those query engines to control the encryption. n nTo avoid massive changes in existing frameworks, the Apache Parquet community designed a schema controlled column encryption mechanism.  The schema of data tables can be leveraged by a system architect in order to define the sensitivity of a column, that will be propagated through the stack and will eventually trigger the encryption on that column in the Apache Parquet writing layer. This solution is applicable in many analytic frameworks via transparent plug-in invocation that avoids massive changes in the frameworks, making Apache Parquet encryption easy to adopt. This mechanism is possible to be extended to support Apache ORC too. n nUse Cases: 1. HDFS ingesting pipelines with Spark and Hudi encrypt sensitive columns automatically with schema-controlled crypto settings. n nIn this use case, we will talk about how to use schema to control column encryption in Apache Parquet, and what is the flow that the pipeline can automatically encrypt the columns once schema sets the sensitivity. n n2. Column access control scalability and performance analysis for analytic frameworks with Apache Hive and Presto on Apache Parquet.n nLike Apache Spark, Apache Hive and Presto are two popular query engines. We will show our analysis on scalability and performance of column access control in an analytic framework. n nSummary: In this talk, we will present the motivation and design of schema-controlled column encryption at file format level, and how it can ease the adoption of encryption features to current popular query engines like Apache Hive, Apache Spark and Presto. Use cases will be presented to show how to use schema controlled column encryption in analytic pipeline and frameworks.",

Starting way before writing the first line of code. After these last two years, I would claim that 'community-building' is by far the most challenging task when initiating a new project, but it's also seems to be one we tend to treat as second-class citizens - even in established projects. Hopefully I will be able to show you how rewarding community-building can be ... After all: Apache is all about community over code and it's that way for a reason",

In this talk we will look back in history, to understand how the integration landscape has evolved from EAI, SOA, and ESB architectures up to microservices, and now with modern serverless and cloud native platforms. Apache Camel has been along for the ride. And we will look to the future and see how the latest release v3 of Apache Camel, is aimed for running modern cloud native workloads with Camel K. In this talk you will:n- Learn from history software integration, and why you should rely on existing, proven fully featured integration frameworks instead of rolling out your own DIY solutionsn- See how software integration is (still) important in today’s modern architectures and what role does Camel have in the new cloud native worldn- What is new and noteworthy in Apache Camel version 3",

      "title": "Serving Clean URLs via Custom Internet Media Types on Tomcat",
      "abstractText": "Increasingly static site generators are being used to create a presence on the web, both for the speed and simplicity of the resulting static pages. A related trend is the use of 'clean' URLs with no resource name extensions, such as `/products/mousetrap` instead of `/products/mousetrap.html`. Clean URLs are more memorable, less fragile, do not leak implementation information, and are more search engine friendly. Because the default Tomcat implementation determines MIME type by filename extension, 'clean' filenames are traditionally produced by servlet mapping or URL rewriting, perhaps coupled with Apache HTTP Server in front of Tomcat using `mod_rewrite`. This presentation shows how Tomcat has been extended to dynamically determine MIME type at runtime based on metadata stored in a parallel file tree or as sidecar files, and to serve the pages with clean resource names directly from Tomcat with no need for URL rewriting. A tutorial on the static site generator Guise Mummy is also included, illustrating how to generate a static site with clean resource names, host the site immediately using embedded Tomcat, and/or deploy the site to AWS S3 using bucket object metadata with a single command.",

In computer science, a framework is a reusable, semi-complete application that can be specialized to produce custom applications [Johnson:88].  After more than two years of actively developing an open source ACF, on October 2017, the NASA AIST OceanWorks project established collaboration with the Apache Software Foundation, called the Apache Science Data Analytics Platform (SDAP). It is a big data analytics platform designed for cloud-based data management, analytics, match-up, and data discovery services. It is a community-support, extensible open source GIS platform. The motivation is to empower the Earth and Space Science Informatics community to develop a common big data solution for the cloud and on-premise cluster. The big data analytics platform is being used to support NASA Sea Level research, GRACE and GRACE Follow-On mission sciences, and NASA Physical Oceanography, etc. This talk describes the Apache SDAP and lesson learned from developing and moving SDAP in production to support various NASA and JPL researches.",

For example, optimizing for geographically-distributed resources, cheap transient resources, disk-based large data shuffle, and skewed data have recently received a lot of interest and attention. The new incubating Apache Nemo project aims to make it easy to express and enforce such optimizations by providing a policy interface that transforms an intermediate representation (IR) of data processing applications. Apache Nemo executes the optimized IR on distributed computers while enforcing the specified scheduling and communication behaviors, and at the same time maintaining the correct application semantics. Apache Nemo is closely integrated with existing Apache Big Data projects. Apache Nemo currently supports optimizing Apache Beam and Apache Spark applications, and uses Apache REEF to run on Apache Hadoop YARN and Apache Mesos. In this talk I will describe how to develop and compose new optimization policies on Apache Nemo, how the optimizations are actually enforced in the distributed execution, and the roadmap to further improve Apache Nemo.",

Originally created at Uber, to power it’s vast big data lake, Hudi provides key features like atomic writes, snapshot isolation, incremental views,  rollbacks, point-in-time restores, file size management & many more. To date, the big data community has been polarized amongst batch and streaming systems, when balancing data freshness and scale. Hudi also addresses a combined need for speed and scale, that does not naturally fit into existing batch and streaming data processing architectures, by way of ability to support continuous ingestion and asynchronous compaction of row & columnar data. In this talk, we will briefly discuss the history of the project - the motivating use-cases & the architectural underpinnings, that spurred the need for such a system. We will examine a blueprint for reliable and state-of-the-art data lake architecture and explain how Hudi’s current capabilities play a central role in it. We will also share hands-on recipes to leverage Hudi in your organization, for popular tasks like data ingestion or ETLs. We will dedicate the remainder of the talk to discussing the roadmap ahead, touching upon areas like external indexing, storage layout organization, as well as advanced topics like building realtime ML feature stores or composing safe multi-stream ETL joins.",

Doris mainly integrates the technology of Google Mesa and Apache Impala. Unlike other popular SQL-on-Hadoop systems, Doris is designed to be a simple and single tightly coupled system, not depending on other systems. Doris not only provides high concurrent low latency point query performance, but also provides high throughput queries of ad-hoc analysis. Doris not only provides batch data loading, but also provides near real-time mini-batch data loading. Doris also provides high availability, reliability, fault tolerance, and scalability. The simplicity (of developing, deploying and using) and meeting many data serving requirements in single system are the main features of Doris.",

      "title": "Inside Apache Druid: Built for High-Performance Real-Time Analytics",
      "abstractText": "Interactive applications are replacing traditional reporting interfaces as the preferred means for organizations to derive value from their datasets. An interactive user experience requires latency on the order of milliseconds. Cluster computing frameworks such as Apache Hadoop or Apache Spark are tremendously beneficial in processing and deriving insights from data. However, high query latency makes these frameworks sub-optimal for interactive applications. Alternatively, the use of relational databases and key/value stores as dedicated query layers can reduce latency, but these approaches suffer many drawbacks for analytic use cases. Apache Druid (incubating) is well suited to power analytic applications working with real-time data and requiring low latency. This talk will cover the current state of analytics world, drawbacks of current popular databases, and what Druid  nbrings to the table. The talk will cover technical details behind Druid’s design, including how its query processing layer works and how each component contributes to achieving top performance for analytical queries.  We will discuss Druid modern architecture that implements a memory-mappable storage format, indexes, compression, late tuple materialization, and a query engine that can operate directly on compressed data. At the time of ApacheCon, Druid will very likely have been granted status as a top-level ASF project. ",

Any improvements to this scheduler can benefit both Kubernetes and YARN community. Abstract: YARN schedulers are optimized for high-throughput, multi-tenant batch workloads. It can scale up to 50k nodes per cluster, and schedule 20k containers per second; On the other side, Kubernetes schedulers are optimized for long-running services, but many features like hierarchical queues, fairness resource sharing, and preemption etc, are either missing or not mature enough at this point of time. However, underneath they are responsible for one same job: the decision maker for resource allocations. We see the need to run services on YARN as well as run jobs on Kubernetes. This motivates us to create a universal scheduler which can work for both YARN and Kubernetes, and configure in the same way. This YuniKorn scheduler (Y for YARN, K for K8s, uni- for Unified) brings long-wanted features such as hierarchical queues, fairness between users/jobs/queues, preemption to Kubernetes; and it brings service scheduling enhancements to YARN. Most importantly, it provides the opportunity to let YARN and Kubernetes share the same user experience on scheduling big data workloads. And any improvements to this scheduler can benefit both Kubernetes and YARN community. In this talk, we’re going to talk about our efforts of design and implement the YuniKorn scheduler. We have integrated it with both YARN and Kubernetes. We will show demos and best practices.n'",

Apache Hadoop YARN and Kubernetes are the de-facto enterprise level resource management system for big data workloads and long-running services. More specifically, big data applications like Spark/Hive-on-Tez/Map-Reduce are all prod-ready on YARN; on the other hand, Kubernetes is good to deploy services.

      "title": "Wire Encryption In HDFS: Protect Your Data From Others, Not Yourself",
      "abstractText": "Wire data encryption is a key component of the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). HDFS can enforce different levels of data protection, allowing users to specify one based on their own needs. However, such enforcement comes in as an all-or-nothing feature. Namely, wire encryption is enforced either for all accesses or none. Since encryption bears a considerable performance cost, the all-or-nothing condition forces users to choose between 'faster but unencrypted' or 'encrypted but slower' for all clients. In our use case at LinkedIn, we would like to selectively expose fast unencrypted access to fully managed internal clients, which can be trusted, while only expose encrypted access to clients outside of the trusted circle with higher security risks. That way we minimize performance overhead for trusted internal clients while still securing data from potential outside threats. We re-evaluate the RPC encryption mechanism in HDFS. Our design extends HDFS NameNode to run on multiple ports. Depending on the configuration, connecting to different NameNode ports would end up with different levels of encryption protection. This protection then gets enforced for both NameNode RPC and the subsequent data transfers to/from DataNode. System administrators then need to set up a simple firewall rule to allow access to the unencrypted port only for internal clients and expose the encrypted port to the outside clients. This approach comes with minimum operational and performance overhead. The feature has been introduced to Apache Hadoop under HDFS-13541.",

It separates the namespace management from block and node management layer, which allows users to independently scale on both axes. Ozone is interoperable with Hadoop ecosystem as it provides OzoneFS (Hadoop compatible file system API), data locality and plug-n-play deployment with HDFS as it can be installed in an existing Hadoop cluster and can share storage disks with HDFS. Ozone solves the scalability challenges with HDFS by being size agnostic. Consequently, it allows users to store trillions of files in Ozone and access them as if they are on HDFS. Ozone plugs into existing Hadoop deployments seamlessly, and programs like Yarn, MapReduce, Spark, Hive and work without any modifications. In the era of increasing need for data privacy and regulations, Ozone also aims to provide built-in support for GDPR compliance with strong focus on Right to be Forgotten i.e., Data Erasure.

      "abstractText": "Hadoop was born much earlier than the Cloud Native era. But the question is still the same: what can it offer in the time of Kubernetes, containerization and hybrid clouds? Apache Hadoop Ozone is a new subproject of Hadoop. It is based a generic low-level binary layer, the Hadoop Distributed Data Storage (HDDS) and a S3 compatible Object Store implementation on top of it. The separation of the data storage layer has multiple benefits: it can help to solve the “small files problem” and increase the scalability of the Hadoop storage clusters but it also helps us to provide access to the same data via multiple interfaces. The same data can be accessed via a Hadoop compatible file system API, with an S3 compatible file system API or as a raw, mountable block device. Storage is still a hot topic with Kubernetes and in Cloud Native environments. Container Storage Interface specification is a vendor neutral standard to provide storage plugin for multiple container orchestration system. With implementing the vendor-independent Container Storage Interface, Ozone can provide block level access on top of the Hadoop Distributed Data Storage layer and it can be first class citizen of the containerized word. In this talk we will demonstrate how the Apache Hadoop Ozone storage could be used from containers, how can the same storage space can be used as Object Store, Hadoop compatible file system or native block device.  We will explain the basic storage type of Kubernetes clusters and show how Apache Hadoop Ozone can help to solve the storage problem in an industry standard way.",

Apache HBase is also often used to handle time series data such as sensor data. We also evaluated HBase for smart meter data a few years ago. HBase is suitable for storing sensor data because it has excellent insert performance, but it is not suitable for big data analysis because scan performance is not so good. On the other hand, Kudu is suitable for both fast insert and big data scan. We evaluated the performance of Kudu for leveraging the power consumption data collected in every second from sensor devices. With this performance test, we confirmed that 4-node Kudu cluster can storing and referring data in real-time generated by 1 million sensor devices. In order to handle a large amount of data in real-time, it is important to increase the memory allocation, to reduce the tablet size, and to define the order of the primary key to reduce the load of compaction. This presentation will introduce the differences between Kudu and other data stores (HBase, HDFS), the use cases suitable for Kudu, and the tuning know-how obtained through performance test.",

In traditional database systems, we can utilize materialized views to accelerate query processing, through pre-computation and query plan rewriting. We adopt a similar method to Spark, allow user to create flexible caches from a query or cube definition, and rewrite user queries at runtime to utilize pre-computed results.

      "title": "Combining schema-on-read and schema-provisioning in Apache Drill",
      "abstractText": "The data generated from IoT devices, machine logs and similar sources is often semi-structured or unstructured. This poses a challenge for traditional schema-on-write systems that require a fixed schema up-front for querying. Modern analytic applications often have ad hoc usage patterns and require tremendous flexibility over how this data can be consumed. Further, they demand that the data be made available for querying soon after it has landed in their data platform – which may be a distributed file system or NoSQL database or something similar. In this talk I will first describe how Apache Drill’s innovative schema-on-read capability built into a distributed SQL query engine meets the demands of such applications. The raw data in various formats can be queried directly from either the distributed file system or other data sources such as NoSQL DBs without having to define a schema up-front. The Drill query planner (in conjunction with Apache Calcite) supports the ‘ANY’ type for columns which allows type validations. During execution, readers produce ‘RecordBatches’ where all rows in one RecordBatch have the same schema but across batches the schema may change. This provides the core foundation for the schema-on-read capability. Downstream SQL operators in the query pipeline perform run-time Java code generation by generating schema specific code. This code is compiled and executed on the JVM and based on this the operator produces output batches. In cases where Drill is not able to infer the schema correctly or when there are ambiguities, Drill has introduced schema provisioning to complement the schema-on-read.  I will describe the functionality to define columns types and nullability, specify columns format and default values and control which columns are projected and their projection order.  The schema can be specified declaratively as part of the query or in a separate file. Our expectation is that these complementary strategies will meet the demands of the modern analytic applications that require schema flexibility in addition to performance and scalability. ",

      "abstractText": "Apache Kafka, Apache Cassandra and Kubernetes are open source big data technologies enabling applications and business operations to scale massively and rapidly. While Kafka and Cassandra underpins the data layer of the stack providing capability to stream, disseminate, store and retrieve data at very low latency, Kubernetes is a container orchestration technology that helps in automated application deployment and scaling of application clusters. In this presentation, we will reveal how we architected a massive scale deployment of a streaming data pipeline with Kafka and Cassandra to cater to an example Anomaly detection application running on a Kubernetes cluster and generating and processing massive amount of events. Anomaly detection is a method used to detect unusual events in an event stream. It is widely used in a range of applications such as financial fraud detection, security, threat detection, website user analytics, sensors, IoT, system health monitoring, etc. When such applications operate at massive scale generating millions or billions of events, they impose significant computational, performance and scalability challenges to anomaly detection algorithms and data layer technologies. We will demonstrate the scalability, performance and cost effectiveness of Apache Kafka, Cassandra and Kubernetes, with results from our experiments allowing the Anomaly detection application to scale to 19 Billion anomaly checks per day.",

      "abstractText": "nIn eventually consistent systems, when a node failures or network partition occurs, we’re presented with a trade-off: to execute a request and sacrifice consistency or reject execution and sacrifice availability. In such system, quorums, overlapping node subsets guaranteeing at least one node to hold the most recent value, can be a good middle-ground. We can tolerate failures and loss of connectivity for some nodes while still serving latest results. Quorum-based replication schemes incur high storage costs: we have to store redundant values on several nodes to guarantee enough copies are going to be available in case of failure. It turns out that we do not have to store data on each replica. We can reduce storage and compute resources by storing the data only a subset of nodes, and only use the other nodes (Transient Replicas), for redundancy in failure scenarios. In this talk, we discuss Witness Replicas, a replication scheme used in Spanner and Megastore, and Apache Cassandra implementation of this concept, called Transient Replication and Cheap Quorums.

It is used by many projects that implement SQL processing capabilities, including Apache Beam and Apache Flink. Over the last years, members of these three communities had many discussions about the semantics and syntax of 'Streaming SQL'. End of last year, we decided to formalize and summarize our views and ideas in paper that we submitted to the Industrial Track of the SIGMOD 2019 conference. The paper got accepted (http://sigmod2019.org/sigmod_industry_list). It presents a three-part proposal for integrating robust streaming into SQL, namely: n(1) time-varying relations as a foundation for classical tables as well as streaming data,n(2) event time semantics, n(3) a limited set of optional keyword extensions to control the materialization of time-varying query results. The paper shows how with these minimal additions it is possible to utilize the complete suite of standard SQL semantics to perform robust stream processing and motivates and illustrate these concepts using examples and describe lessons learned from implementations in Apache Calcite, Apache Flink, and Apache Beam. In this talk, we present our 'Syntactically Idiomatic Approach to Manage Streams and Tables'.",

Pulsar SQL is a query layer built on top of Apache Pulsar (a next-gen messaging platform), that enables users to dynamically query all streams, old and new, stored inside of Pulsar. Thus, users can unlock insights from querying both new and historical streams of data in a single system. Pulsar SQL leverages Presto and Apache Pulsar’s unique architecture to execute queries in a highly scalable fashion regardless of the number of partitions of topics that make up the streams. In this talk, we will examine the use cases and advantages of being able to interactively query events within an streaming messagingnplatform and how Pulsar enables users to do that in the most user-friendly and efficient manner.",

In this talk, we will introduce how Pulsar provides a powerful computing power based on the serverless computing architecture. Apache Pulsar is a new generation of cloud messaging system and real-time processing platform. The message system is closely related to the real-time computing platform, but it is often loosely deployed and managed separately. Pulsar Functions, as the computing component of Pulsar, is a fusion and innovation of the message and computing platform in the serverless direction. Pulsar Functions provides support for multiple languages such as Go, Python, and Java; and runtimes such as Thread, Process, and Kubernetes. This provides great flexibility for user-written, run, and deploy features. Let users only use logic that cares about real calculations, without complicated configuration or management; it is easier to build a message-triggered flow platform.",

Part of Kafka is its stream processing API “Kafka Streams”. In addition, the Kafka ecosystem now offers KSQL, a declarative, SQL-like stream processing language that lets you define powerful stream-processing applications easily. What once took some moderately sophisticated Java code can now be done at the command line with a familiar and eminently approachable syntax.nThis session discusses and demos the pros and cons of Kafka Streams and KSQL to understand when to use which stream processing alternative for continuous stream processing natively on Apache Kafka infrastructures. The end of the session compares the trade-offs of Kafka Streams and KSQL to separate stream processing frameworks such as Apache Flink or Spark Streaming.",

Today’s most of ETL processed data are stored in HDFS and cloud, and leveraging this data to design strong ML models is a big challenge for a data scientist. In Big Data ecosystem, most of the ETL and batch jobs are running on Spark and Hive which process/ingest data to the same data stores. Data scientists find this challenging in order to effectively utilize these big data workloads to develop an effective ML model. Hadoop Submarine (https://hadoop.apache.org/submarine/) helps to bring these two worlds together and provides seamless integration across. Ecosystem around Hadoop Submarine helps to design and run ML workloads from a notebook. Integrations with notebook such as Zeppelin and workflow scheduler like Azkaban, helps user to consume data from spark or hive and effectively run ML jobs with ease on any compute cluster. In this deep dive session, we will demo the simplicity of Submarine by running distributed deep learning/machine learning applications on YARN and Kubernetes as simple as running it locally. We will also showcase the community effort in developing Submarine’s ecosystem which eases integrations with Zeppelin and Azkaban. Submarine project could easily launch in the same cluster to run DL/ML jobs without any additional upgrades or complexities of having different machines.n'",

Nowadays It is too important to have an offline first application because in many rural areas, it is exceptionally hard to find an internet connection, sometimes taking days to get connected if a natural disaster happens Still, there are some areas where internet connection is still not even present and despite the many global efforts to bring connectivity forward, there are regions where there is still no timeline for connectivity. On the bright side, people can get access to an internet connection but they have to travel for that. Apache fineract-cn-mobile 2.0 is a native Android application built on the top of Apache Fineract-CN. Apache Fineract CN is an Application Framework for Digital Financial Services. It is a system to support nationwide financial transactions and to support the creation of an inclusive, interconnected digital economy for every nation in the world. Mobile devices are now in the palm of almost every hand worldwide, some high-speed internet connection and some with no internet or very slow internet connection in many places. I present Apache fineract-cn-mobile 2.0 that is the open source offline-first mobile banking application build on top of Apache Fineract-CN and maintained with Android Jetpack. Now we have eliminated as a barrier, no network or slow internet connection.  The codebase is very simple and easy to fix and debug. Typically as a project grows, so does its complexity, but with Android Jetpack and MVVP architecture, complexity remains nearly a constant  as when it was written in the first implementation. Fineract-cn-mobile 2.0 solves the topmost problem in financial institutions application development.n1. Maintainability and scalability with MVVM architecture and Android Jetpack (This give us the ability to adopt a new architecture that will come in future better than MVVM ).n2. Sustainability with ease of data synchronization.n3. Battery  Optimizatio 4. Offline first, No need for internet connection. WorkManager jobs take care of data sync to the server and from the server.n5. Easy learnable UI & UX.n6. Easy SQLite local database management with Roomn7. Logic abstraction with MVVP (Model View ViewModel)n8. Updating UI with LiveData I will be talking about the above problems that we solved with latest Android tech. I will guide developers on how they can pick up the codebase and can develop high-standard features according to his/her need and can manage customers entirely from Android device and How fineract-cn-mobile helps alleviate poverty and makes banking paperless.",

      "abstractText": "Failures are inevitable. But when they occur, our goal should be to resolve them as quickly and efficiently as possible. PagerDuty has developed an open-source Incident Response framework based on the Incident Command System (ICS). That product-independent process has helped many organizations set up Incident Response processes that resolve technical issues as quickly and effectively as possible. There's a lot of documentation you can follow, but how do incidents actually play out in real-time when they happen? In this talk, you get to peek behind the curtain to see what happens inside the walls of the company that's known for waking you up to tell you there's a technical incident you need to deal with. We will walk through a cascading failure that happened when unexpected errors were found happening in one of our Kafka clusters. I share all the gritty details of this actual incident, as they occurred, and use that as a way to demonstrate the structure of how we apply ICS to resolving technical problems. Attendees of this talk will walk away with an understanding of how to effectively manage complex technical incidents across multiple teams, the additional roles that are necessary to support technical responders, how to structure a blameless post-mortem, and how to start developing a similar process in their own organizations. This talk delves into technical concepts due to the nature of the problem, but it is mostly focused on the mechanics of managing any technical incident.",

Spark is not only a mature system, but thanks to its support of multiple resource managers like Hadoop, Mesos, and Kubernetes it has become a popular choice for both batch and streaming workloads in the industry.  Apache Beam has included a Spark runner since its inception to allow users to execute Beam pipelines on Spark, but until recently the Spark runner could only execute pipelines written in Java. In this talk we will introduce the portability framework and how we adapted it into the existing Spark runner translation to make the Spark runner portable.  We will show you how to execute Beam pipelines written in Python and Golang in Spark with Beam and invite you to use the new Spark Portable Runner. We will mention the use case of Tensorflow Extended, the end-to-end platform for data validation and transformation and ML model analysis. Finally we will discuss ongoing work and some future plans for the portable runner.",

In this sense, Apache Beam is not an exception - it provides a rich API to develop a new connector with your favorite SDK and easily integrate it with Beam runners.  In this talk we are going to show you how to write your own IO connector (in Java). We will see what are the differences between bounded and unbounded sources, how to implement efficient sources and sinks and where we need to pay more attention during the development, what kind of API your connector should provide to users and how it can be tested. To achieve this we will rely on examples from existing Beam connectors.  We will also give a brief overview of a rather recent feature/pattern in Beam IO - Composable IO connectors and the Splittable DoFn API. We will discuss the advantages of modular IO API design and some new IO design patterns allowed by this style.  This talk will be interesting for people, who consider to write their own IO connectors or want to contribute to existing ones, as well as for Beam users, who wish to understand how existing Beam connectors work under the hood.",

      "title": "Unifying Batch and Stream Data Processing with Apache Calcite and Apache Beam",
      "abstractText": "At LinkedIn, we have a large and ever-expanding corpus of big data processing code written using batch processing frameworks like Pig, Hive, and Spark. These data processing pipelines produce derived data artifacts like metrics, dimensions, and features and are generally run at daily or hourly end-to-end latencies. For a subset of these artifacts, there often arises a need to produce them at a faster cadence, say minutely or even continuously. At that point, the common practice used to be that the developer would re-write the same derivation logic using a stream processing framework (Apache Samza in case of LinkedIn). This causes two problems: \n 1. The time to go from a pipeline that generates data at hourly grain to a pipeline that generates the same data continuously is governed by developer time to understand the batch code and rewrite it in streaming language; typically weeks to a month to fully operationalize this pipeline. \n 2. The rewritten pipeline may not be exactly the same as the batch pipeline because of subtle differences in the logic or UDFs across the two code bases. Over time these pipelines can continue to diverge especially if different teams own the batch and streaming pipelines.\n In this talk, we present our solution to this batch-stream divide; a system that can auto-generate streaming code from batch logic and employ the Lambda architecture to transparently deliver merged results to data consumers. Technically, our Lambda architecture is very similar to the traditional Lambda architecture; however, our users only need to maintain a single code base in batch logic. This code base serves as a single source of truth to specify what users want to compute. If they need fresher results, they just need to turn on the streaming flag.\n We will deep-dive into technical details for this system which is built using open source components: Apache Beam and Apache Calcite. We’ll also share our experience using this system to auto-migrate batch scripts in our unified metrics platform into near realtime pipelines running on Apache Samza and our plans in the future to share this with the community.",

      "abstractText": "We built a scalable and flexible stream data pipeline for our microservices on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), using Cloud Pub/Sub, Google Cloud Storage, BigQuery, and Cloud Dataflow, using Apache Beam. The stream data pipeline is working on the production system for Mercari, one of the biggest C2C e-commerce services in Japan. The pipeline currently accepts logs from 5+ microservices, and the number will increase soon.\n Our microservice architecture is based on the following three concepts:\n 1. Split the log collection and data processing phases to keep the system simple.\n 2. Use stream processing in order to achieve low latency. \n 3. Don’t just accumulate raw data—support structured output that is easier to use.\n Based on these concepts, we built a data pipeline in GCP.\n For each microservice, we will provide a Cloud Pub/Sub “Ramp” to send logs to. Cloud Pub/Sub can have messages that contain an optional byte array in their payloads. The entire message that is ingested into the Ramp uses Cloud Dataflow streaming processing to collect them in the “RawDataHub,” a Cloud Pub/Sub topic for collection. When this happens, the PubsubMessage payload is not changed at all; the metadata necessary for subsequent processing (destination and schema information, data necessary for pipeline metrics, etc.) is provided in the PubsubMessage’s attribute map. This Dataflow job does not do processing for each service or topic—it treats all messages uniformly.\n The raw data from RawDataHub is then output to two independent Cloud DataFlow streaming processes: “RawDataLake”(the infrastructure is in Google Cloud Storage, or “GCS”) and “StructuredDataHub”, another Cloud Pub/Sub topic. The StructuredDataHub has structured avro records. \n The structured data from StructuredDataHub is then sent to more two independent Cloud DataFlow streaming processes: “StructuredDataLake” on GCS and “Data WareHouse” (Google BigQuery).",

There is significant overlap between these two problem spaces, and we should consider using these models together for the benefit of both projects.  \n In this talk, I will describe both of these projects at a high-level, and present a vision for how they can be used together. I will also discuss some of the concerns around using a batched columnar data format in the Beam model, along with potential solutions.",

Unfortunately, when it comes to stream processing Python presents several challenges, including performance limitations, lack of proper multi-threading support and limited framework options.  \n When the use cases for more advanced stream processing started to arise, at Yelp we decided to leverage Flink and introduce a Scala/Java stack for our Data Pipeline. Over the course of two years we built our connector ecosystem in Flink and exposed to developers a very lightweight stream processing API based on Flink SQL.  \n While Flink SQL was quickly adopted by our developers, we soon realized that more complex use cases cannot easily be solved in Flink SQL. At the same time, the alternative engineering cost to develop and maintain a complex production application in an unfamiliar JVM based language was not convenient for our product teams.  \n At the beginning of the year, we started looking at Apache Beam with the goal of filling the gap between the high level Flink SQL api and the low level advanced Java Flink streaming API. In this talk I’ll cover the motivations and use cases that brought us to adopt Apache Beam, the challenges we faced integrating Beam with an existing Flink infrastructure and the strategy we followed to deploy and productionize at scale.",

By using Ludwig, experts and researchers can simplify the prototyping process and streamline data processing so that they can focus on developing deep learning architectures rather than data wrangling.  \n Ludwig introduces the notion of data type-specific encoders and decoders, which results in a highly modularized and extensible architecture: each type of data supported (text, images, categories, and so on) has a specific preprocessing function.  \n In this talk, we’ll be looking at building Beam pipelines to programmatically create Deep Learning models with Ludwig for different input data types for both model training and inference using Beam-Python SDK. We will be showing 2 examples of training deep learning classifiers with text and images on an unbounded source and running inference on that.  ",

      "title": "Pricing Lyft rides with Apache Beam - a case study in migrating from a worker-based workflow to streaming",
      "abstractText": "Ride-sharing is a two-sided marketplace; balancing supply and demand with price in real time is critical to maintaining an efficient system. Dynamic pricing creates fairness for drivers (by raising rates when there is a lot of demand) and maintains good experiences for passengers (by satisfying pick-up time SLAs). This complex system makes real-time decisions using various data sources; machine learning models; and a streaming infrastructure for low latency, reliability and scalability. In this streaming infrastructure, our system consumes a massive number of events from different sources to make these pricing decisions.\n \n Reacting to these events in a cron scheduler based legacy infrastructure with inherent latency becomes a challenge, especially where timely reactions are required to balance market conditions. By leveraging Apache Beam, Lyft’s Streaming Platform powers pricing by bringing together the best of two worlds: ML models in Python and Apache Flink on JVM as the streaming engine.Topics covered in this talk include:\n * A brief discussion of dynamic pricing, including motivation and high-level problem formulation\n * Comparison of legacy architecture and new streaming architecture\n * Overview of streaming platform architecture and technology stack\n * Major gains from streaming architecture\n * Lessons learned ",

      "title": "Writing the Hazelcast Jet Runner",
      "abstractText": "Hazelcast Jet is a distributed data processing engine that treats all data as a stream. Jet is built on top of Hazelcast IMDG and thanks to this the Jet cluster can also play the role of the data source and sink. If you use Jet this way, you can achieve perfect data locality and top-of- the-class throughputs.\n Jet uses cooperative multithreading (comparable to green threads), its processors correspond to standalone single-threaded tasks that process streams of data. By not depending on OS-level thread scheduling Jet can achieve greater throughput and better saturate the CPU cores. Since the theory underlying Apache Beam has also influenced the development of Jet and there are many conceptual similarities, attempting to write a Runner based on Jet came naturally to us. When we started however the first big obstacle we hit was the relative lack of documentation. Figuring out what exactly a Runner needed to do required reverse engineering existing runners.\n A second obstacle turned out to be the generic nature of the user defined functions used by Beam. While Jet's cooperative execution model allows for great performance, it requires the processing of the data to be non-blocking and this is hard to assure when running completely opaque and generic DoFns.\n Yet another difficulty was presented by trying to adapt Jet's fault tolerance and processing guarantee mechanism for the Runner, a process that, even though difficult, might be more solvable than the above mentioned non-blocking requirement.\n Despite these difficulties implementing an initial version of our runner turned out to be quite doable, even though experimental it's quite capable of running a majority of the existing Beam test suits and we are proud to say that we are now listed on the Capability Matrix. We can also showcase Nexmark test results of our runner and describe possible avenues for future development.",

Last summer, she invented the world's first-ever AI board game, CoderMindz. Her goal is to help one billion kids gain access to coding tools by the time she goes to college, and she’s very well on her way with her 1 Billion Kids Can Code initiative. At 10, Samaira is among one of the youngest keynote speakers and has been speaking at various corporations, events, and conferences including the world-famous Mobile World Congress MWC, Barcelona, attended by 107,000 attendees. Samaira has been covered by news, print, and media in over 100 countries. She’s also a singer, composer, blog writer, and loves to play guitar.",
