But they also look at the costs and often we develop the exact same app twice. There is a potential cold war brewing between PWAs and Native apps with no clear shakeout in sight. Might the web win?

Or do we all need to just be proficient at machine learning? And what we code, will it be functional? This panel will discuss what the landscape will look like for developers in the next few years and answer questions about how to stay current, future-proof your skillset and how you can influence the future.

Already Developers are confronted with a number of multi-platform technologies and frameworks such as Flutter, Kotlin/Native, React Native (and moreâ¦).  Or do we all need to just be proficient at machine learning? And what we code, will it be functional? This panel will discuss what the landscape will look like for developers in the next few years and answer questions about how to stay current, future-proof your skillset and how you can influence the future.

Not getting sued gives you more time to develop your app and expand your business. It helps you to avoid awkward calls with your lawyers. And no one wants those.\r\n \r\nThe session will be first part of 90 minutes and will provide you with an analyses from a few GDPR cases that actually lead to fines by data protection authorities. We will cover what were the factual and legal reasons for those fines and what are the lessons learned from these cases. The idea is to enable you to avoid data protection violations already committed by other parties in the past. \r\n",

And no one wants those.\r\n\r\nThis second part of the session will comprise nearly everything that has to do with mobile gaming. We will take about mobile payments and in-app purchases â not only interesting for the game developers â as well as how to avoid legal pitfalls concerning the content and marketing of games. ",

In this talk, Iâll cover some of the lessons we learned while gradually migrating from a RecyclerView.Adapter, populated from a tightly coupled domain and presentation layers, to Paging library. Youâll learn about the main components of the Paging library, where they fit in your architecture, how decoupling the UI and the data/domain layers results in more maintainable & testable code. Youâll understand which DataSource type you need for your use case see how you can display multiple data types in the same RecyclerView and how to handle other use cases like interactions with a view item, deleting or inserting an item, selection states or showing section headers. Learn from our experience how to migrate to paging and the benefits we saw.",

                        "description": "Reactive applications are the norm on the web. Android applications have begun increasingly reactive using architectures like MVVM, MVI, Redux, etc., The reactive nature of these applications are due to the underlying architecture rather than the UI framework itself. This has resulted in some big wins like testability and strong separation of concerns while trading-off attributes like time-to-market and quickly on-boarding new developers to an existing project.\r\n\r\nThe API surface of the Android UI framework has been the same for the past decade. This was largely because of the limitations imposed by old tooling and the programming language. With Kotlin bringing in DSLs, functional programming and compiler plugin capabilities - the members of the Android UI Toolkit team have rolled up their sleeves and are taking a new direction. The new UI toolkit is backed by principles and techniques like - one-way data flow, function composition, declarative programming, optimistic concurrency control, isolation of side-effects, etc.,\r\n\r\nThis shift in API design also demands a shift in thinking about the app architecture and building UIs. In this talk, weâll see how Jetpack Compose is radically different from the existing Android UI framework and how it adopts several ideas and programming patterns from web frameworks like React, MobX, and Vue.js. We will also see examples of these patterns and use them to build Android apps.",

Giving Fragments a second chance is not something Iâd ever thought Iâd be saying, but itâs a fantastic opportunity to find a solution to sharing data across a single screen.\r\n\r\nExplore with me as I walk you through my  experience implementing the navigation library and safeargs, and how I used them to implement type safe argument bindings, and how you can utilise the once troubled framework type to your advantage.",

We established with designers a UIKit, a pattern library, implemented as an Android library and inspired from Atomic Design, defining every UI component of the app. \r\n\r\nDuring the presentation, we will dive in the UIKit to see how components are defined and organized, integrated in the app with global architecture, and the implications on the design and development process in our team.\r\n",

But over time, new features came into play, network calls, asynchronous processing, your little baby turned out to be a monster and you loose yourself in the code, itâs not possible to tell in which state your app is between network calls, errors, user interactions, etc.. Youâre lost !\r\n\r\nGrox is an open source library (https://github.com/groupon/grox) that helps to manage the state of Kotlin / Java / Android applications. Inspired by Flux and Redux, Grox lets you express state changes in a testable and homogenous way. Grox offers a flexible, scalable way to manage the state of your application. With Grox you know in which exact state you are at any point in time, and you state will be represented clearly. Grox also offers time travel debugging, and a nice Rx API that plays very well with RxBinding and asynchronous code. \r\n\r\nIn this session, we will explain why Grox is nice, give a few examples to use it, test your code and enjoy itâs scalability. You will see that Grox is a breeze to manage from the simplest app to the most complex ones.",

That means we need to embed a WebView in our application and create a bridge between the native code and the JavaScript running on the web page we load.\r\n\r\nIn this session you will learn everything there is about how to deal with the WebView on Android. Learn how to properly load content, inject your own CSS or JavaScript, how to effectively communicate between JavaScript and Android, and how to make loading web content secure in Android applications. We will also look at how to implement some common use cases, like displaying ePub and other HTML-based e-books.",

Every piece of code we write is (hopefully) carefully reviewed by our teammates before becoming part of our systems. It's an important part of the development process, and it requires significant time and effort.\r\n\r\nWhile a great review experience will promote interesting discussions, ensure consistency in the codebase, and potentially catch bugs and implementation oversights, a poor review might lead to nasty bugs and unhappy developers. Still, sometimes it's hard to find the motivation to thoroughly review a pull request, and eventually it just doesn't seem to be worth it given the time you'll need to spend and how hard it usually is to properly review those huge PRs that pop up every now and then.\r\n\r\nIn this talk you'll learn strategies and guidelines that will help improve the efficiency of your team's code reviews. We'll talk about work in progress PRs, commit by commit reviews, emoji driven comments and more. You'll listen to great (and scary) tales of code reviews experiences, and lots of tips and tricks when it comes to preparing the perfect pull request for your peers.",

From rounds of manual regression testing then onto automated UI testing now to isolated code level tests and whatâs next  for the team.  \r\n\r\nThen: How we started with UI automation to help us release quicker and what it actually gave us: fast checks of key user journeys but not an automated regression test suite that could help us release faster. \r\n\r\nNow: How we looked to push more of our testing down the stack into unit testing, but starting with building a team understanding of what unit tests actually are. How we broke down our system into interdependent components that could be tested in isolation and the architecture we used to push this further. All explained through a real life example of how we moved to the new ExoPlayer from google. \r\n\r\nNext: What new problems this approach has given us, how we plan tackle them and how we will bring this approach this to other teams across the BBC. \r\n\r\nKey takeaways\r\n- Testing: What has and hasnât worked with our testing from manual to automated testing and everything in between \r\n- Pairing: How we collaboratively pair tester and developers to write code level tests \r\n- Team structure: How our teams are organised and why \r\nRisk Vs Value: How we balance the risk of not testing Vs value of testing it \r\n",

Let us introduce one more dish to the table - GoMobile. You can write code in what could be your favourite language(Golang) and port it to Android and iOS platforms. Come hear how it works and have a taste. Then decide if this is going to be your daily meal or occasional food :)",

In this talk, Iâll cover some of the lessons we learned while gradually migrating from a RecyclerView.Adapter, populated from a tightly coupled domain and presentation layers, to Paging library. Youâll learn about the main components of the Paging library, where they fit in your architecture, how decoupling the UI and the data/domain layers results in more maintainable & testable code. Youâll understand which DataSource type you need for your use case see how you can display multiple data types in the same RecyclerView and how to handle other use cases like interactions with a view item, deleting or inserting an item, selection states or showing section headers.

                            "description": "Reactive applications are the norm on the web. Android applications have begun increasingly reactive using architectures like MVVM, MVI, Redux, etc., The reactive nature of these applications are due to the underlying architecture rather than the UI framework itself. This has resulted in some big wins like testability and strong separation of concerns while trading-off attributes like time-to-market and quickly on-boarding new developers to an existing project.\r\n\r\nThe API surface of the Android UI framework has been the same for the past decade. This was largely because of the limitations imposed by old tooling and the programming language. With Kotlin bringing in DSLs, functional programming and compiler plugin capabilities - the members of the Android UI Toolkit team have rolled up their sleeves and are taking a new direction. The new UI toolkit is backed by principles and techniques like - one-way data flow, function composition, declarative programming, optimistic concurrency control, isolation of side-effects, etc.,\r\n\r\nThis shift in API design also demands a shift in thinking about the app architecture and building UIs. In this talk, weâll see how Jetpack Compose is radically different from the existing Android UI framework and how it adopts several ideas and programming patterns from web frameworks like React, MobX, and Vue.js. We will also see examples of these patterns and use them to build Android apps.",

Giving Fragments a second chance is not something Iâd ever thought Iâd be saying, but itâs a fantastic opportunity to find a solution to sharing data across a single screen.\r\n\r\nExplore with me as I walk you through my  experience implementing the navigation library and safeargs, and how I used them to implement type safe argument bindings, and how you can utilise the once troubled framework type to your advantage.",

However, as we will see, implementing certificate pinning requires us to answer questions such as which certificate to pin against that doesnât have a straight forward answer.\r\n\r\nWe will introduce certificate transparency which has already replaced certificate pinning in Google Chrome and show how to use it on Android with a new open source certificate transparency library from Babylon Health.",

Let us introduce one more dish to the table - GoMobile. You can write code in what could be your favourite language(Golang) and port it to Android and iOS platforms. Come hear how it works and have a taste. Then decide if this is going to be your daily meal or occasional food :)",

Every piece of code we write is (hopefully) carefully reviewed by our teammates before becoming part of our systems. It's an important part of the development process, and it requires significant time and effort.\r\n\r\nWhile a great review experience will promote interesting discussions, ensure consistency in the codebase, and potentially catch bugs and implementation oversights, a poor review might lead to nasty bugs and unhappy developers. Still, sometimes it's hard to find the motivation to thoroughly review a pull request, and eventually it just doesn't seem to be worth it given the time you'll need to spend and how hard it usually is to properly review those huge PRs that pop up every now and then.\r\n\r\nIn this talk you'll learn strategies and guidelines that will help improve the efficiency of your team's code reviews. We'll talk about work in progress PRs, commit by commit reviews, emoji driven comments and more. You'll listen to great (and scary) tales of code reviews experiences, and lots of tips and tricks when it comes to preparing the perfect pull request for your peers.",

We established with designers a UIKit, a pattern library, implemented as an Android library and inspired from Atomic Design, defining every UI component of the app. \r\n\r\nDuring the presentation, we will dive in the UIKit to see how components are defined and organized, integrated in the app with global architecture, and the implications on the design and development process in our team.\r\n",

In this talk, we explore how experienced developers can leverage the power of social media to grow as mentors, and help students gain the most appropriate skills before joining the workforce.",

From rounds of manual regression testing then onto automated UI testing now to isolated code level tests and whatâs next  for the team.  \r\n\r\nThen: How we started with UI automation to help us release quicker and what it actually gave us: fast checks of key user journeys but not an automated regression test suite that could help us release faster. \r\n\r\nNow: How we looked to push more of our testing down the stack into unit testing, but starting with building a team understanding of what unit tests actually are. How we broke down our system into interdependent components that could be tested in isolation and the architecture we used to push this further. All explained through a real life example of how we moved to the new ExoPlayer from google. \r\n\r\nNext: What new problems this approach has given us, how we plan tackle them and how we will bring this approach this to other teams across the BBC. \r\n\r\nKey takeaways\r\n- Testing: What has and hasnât worked with our testing from manual to automated testing and everything in between \r\n- Pairing: How we collaboratively pair tester and developers to write code level tests \r\n- Team structure: How our teams are organised and why \r\nRisk Vs Value: How we balance the risk of not testing Vs value of testing it \r\n",

It is also a heavily researched topic by developers with 20k questions on stack overflow(2k+ for dagger).\r\nWhile most projects use dagger as a de-facto framework for Android, this talk would be more focussed on understanding concepts of DI and applying the same without a framework. Weâll go through concepts of supplying dependencies, various types of injection and understanding inversion of control. All of this without using a framework, with raw code in Kotlin and an actual android app with real life problems around networking, storage and threading.\r\nWeâll then dig deep in how libraries like Dagger, Koin etc operate to provide the same with code generation or reflection.",

But over time, new features came into play, network calls, asynchronous processing, your little baby turned out to be a monster and you loose yourself in the code, itâs not possible to tell in which state your app is between network calls, errors, user interactions, etc.. Youâre lost !\r\n\r\nGrox is an open source library (https://github.com/groupon/grox) that helps to manage the state of Kotlin / Java / Android applications. Inspired by Flux and Redux, Grox lets you express state changes in a testable and homogenous way. Grox offers a flexible, scalable way to manage the state of your application. With Grox you know in which exact state you are at any point in time, and you state will be represented clearly. Grox also offers time travel debugging, and a nice Rx API that plays very well with RxBinding and asynchronous code. \r\n\r\nIn this session, we will explain why Grox is nice, give a few examples to use it, test your code and enjoy itâs scalability. You will see that Grox is a breeze to manage from the simplest app to the most complex ones.",

With on-device computation you can improve the performance of your app and resolve privacy and cost related issues. \r\nIn this session, I will show you how to use HiAI: a mobile computing platforms that make the developers able to run artificial intelligence algorithms on device.

This is helpful to validate certain parts of your app that are repeatedly accessed such as going into details of items, or scrolling through an infinite list. \r\nThe measurements help you monitor if your app performance is slowing down. Because of this, you can integrate it to your CI. We'll show a real life scenario of benchmarks on the OLX app and show you how you can integrate it in your CI tool.",

Developers will learn what it takes to get their existing code base ready and how to make use of dynamic delivery right away.\r\n\r\nWith new features being developed in apps continuously it can be daunting to find the right angle to get started. I aim to provide guidance from lessons learned and best practices so you don't have to go through the learning curve all on your own.\r\n\r\nI have been working with App Bundles, dynamic delivery and modularization and sharing knowledge around the topic for the past years.",

Besides the already existing tools, such as Property Animation framework, Layout transitions or Animated Vector Drawables, Google also brought in the ConstraintLayout 2.0, the new MotionLayout.\r\n\r\nWith this layout, animations are made easy and intuitive. In this talk, we will be able to take a brief look at: \r\n1. Basic animation transitions based on Constraints\r\n2. Image transitions\r\n3. How to use keyframes\r\nand\r\n4.

We will look at some of the mistakes I did and some of the approaches I took while learning FP. We will also create a simple structured approach to start learning/implementing FP in your existing code so that you can learn by doing. We will see real life practical examples of implementing FP in your Android project by converting a few samples from OOP to FP. \r\n\r\nAt the end of the talk we will look at why a library like Arrow-KT can be useful once you have mastered the basics of FP and also how to approach Arrow-KT for your FP needs. \r\n",

The consumer arguments of which side is better, and what phones are better regularly leak into our work and quite frankly taint our ability to make great applications for our users. As developers, we are sometimes subject to the whims and biases of designers and product managers. However, we have to take responsibility for ensuring that our mobile products as a whole are enjoyable and consistent for our users. \r\n\r\nAt Monzo, there is a culture of collaboration, which has resulted in the mobile apps becoming closer and closer in feature parity. However, there are still issues, and definitely lessons from the past, which I will detail in this talk. I will also delve into the issues with the more black and white thought processes that plague the industry, what damage they can cause and how much of a detriment to your product they can be. She will then go on to explain how, by working together and appreciating the benefits of both sides, you can ultimately design and build apps that everybody will love, and also be happier in our work.",

Navigation in Android can be done explicitly by passing the class variable or implicit by sending an Intent with a certain configuration. Since modularization is supposed to simplify our dependency graph, we will take a closer look at deep linking as a navigation pattern and compare different approaches like Intent filter, a custom deeplink processor or the Android Jetpack Navigation component. \r\n\r\nAfter this talk, you will be able to modularize your application with a clean, structured and scalable navigation.

Even though Kotlin abstracts away much of the virtual machine and the original feature set of Java with its own features, itâs still important to know what your Kotlin code compiles to. Not only can this knowledge give you the power to optimize your code, but it will also help you avoid subtle bugs that would otherwise be near impossible to track down.",

                        "description": "This talk will give you the tools to prepare for interviews, whether itâs making your hiring process better, or simply preparing for an interview as a candidate. \r\n\r\nAs a candidate, interviewing for a new job can be quite stressful and time consuming. It feels like you are being put through an exam. Often, we forget we are also evaluating the company we are interviewing with, especially when we start interviewing for the first time, and it is hard to know what to look for.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, interviewing candidates for a position can be stressful too. You want to find the perfect person to join your team, but there are many factors that feel out of our hands (e.g. rain can affect the mood of the candidate and the person interviewing and impact the result). We need to effectively control the factors that we can.\r\n\r\nWith this talk we want to focus on the whole process of finding the right people to work with, from the job advert to the offer. And we want to do it from both points of view, as the company and as the candidate.\r\n\r\nWe want to show candidates behind the scenes of the interviewing process, to make it feel less intimidating. We want to teach them how to choose a job and a company that fits with them. We want to give some tips on how to prepare for interviews, and the sort of exercises they might encounter.\r\n\r\nWe also want to help companies improve their hiring process. There is no solution that works for everyone, but there are patterns everyone can follow to do better. We want to show them how to reach candidates, make sure qualified candidates apply, show them how to deal with the unavoidable biases they will face, help them understand the pros and cons of different types of  exercises, and finally, help them find the perfect new hire for their team.\r\n\r\nHiring and interviewing is not easy, and there is no easy solution to it. But we hope that with this talk we would make it a little bit better for everyone involved.",

Minimalism in computing is not a novel idea, it existed back in the 80s when the resources were very expensive and limited.\r\n\r\nNowadays, our software development processes seem to have forgot about it. We deploy entire frameworks, or even entire operating systems, to perform a single task. We include libraries in our projects even when we just need a single method. We create bloated products that cram as much features as we can, rather than focusing on doing one thing right. As well, we have problems focusing at work, we struggle to get things done, and all together our mental health is not improving.\r\n\r\nI believe that is all related, that we should take a step back, simplify, start small, and declutter.\r\n\r\nCome and learn about the principles of minimalism, and how to apply them to your personal and professional life. You will learn about the importance of keeping things simple, learning to focus on the things that matter to make a positive impact in yours, your teamâs and your users' lives.",

One of the questions that I invariably get asked is \"how do I get the rest of my team and company onboard?\"\r\n\r\nLast year, I started working at a fast-paced, rapidly growing startup in the UK. I was really overwhelmed, and I had a hard-enough time getting through my day-to-day work that I felt guilty that I couldn't give the requisite time to make sure my output was accessible. Something had to change and it did.\r\n\r\nThis is a story about what we did to drive inclusive design at our company, and how you can do the same.",

We at Sky are no different, we had a big monolithic codebase supporting 4 apps in different countries that we started modularizing in September 2017. But we failed, big time.\r\n\r\nThis talk is an honest retrospective of everything that went wrong, the bad decisions that we made, the approach we initially took and how we, against all odds, eventually started re-building a maintainable, sustainable and extensible modularized codebase. In this talk you will learn from our mistakes and struggles, like defining what is a module and its responsibilities, how to integrate Dagger in a multi-module environment, set some rules and best practices and much more but, more importantly, you will learn what not to do when modularizing your codebase.",

In this talk, we will look at how to get started with FP using Kotlin with the existing knowledge you have and look at how we can start moving towards FP by making a few changes(trust me, no talking about the jargon or 3rd party libraries) in your day to day activities. \r\n\r\nI will also talk about my journey about going from OOP to FP. We will look at some of the mistakes I did and some of the approaches I took while learning FP. We will also create a simple structured approach to start learning/implementing FP in your existing code so that you can learn by doing. We will see real life practical examples of implementing FP in your Android project by converting a few samples from OOP to FP. \r\n\r\nAt the end of the talk we will look at why a library like Arrow-KT can be useful once you have mastered the basics of FP and also how to approach Arrow-KT for your FP needs. \r\n",

In this talk, I will share reflections from my time at N26, where weâre building the bank the world loves to use. \r\n\r\nWeâll look at questions like: What were our biggest technical challenges? How did we prevent bottlenecks? How did we maintain consistency and not block creativity? What were our biggest mistakes and how did we solve them? Weâll also explore the importance of documentation during this process. \r\n\r\nBy the end of this talk you will have a better understanding of the problems scaling an Android team, how to tackle them and how to create a safe and productive environment.",

This library allows you to measure the speed of certain parts of your application. This is helpful to validate certain parts of your app that are repeatedly accessed such as going into details of items, or scrolling through an infinite list. \r\nThe measurements help you monitor if your app performance is slowing down. Because of this, you can integrate it to your CI. We'll show a real life scenario of benchmarks on the OLX app and show you how you can integrate it in your CI tool.",

Nowadays most applications are modularized to a certain degree - to combat high compile times, enforce separation of concerns or to group code based on certain scopes.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will take a look at navigation in modularized apps. Navigation in Android can be done explicitly by passing the class variable or implicit by sending an Intent with a certain configuration. Since modularization is supposed to simplify our dependency graph, we will take a closer look at deep linking as a navigation pattern and compare different approaches like Intent filter, a custom deeplink processor or the Android Jetpack Navigation component. \r\n\r\nAfter this talk, you will be able to modularize your application with a clean, structured and scalable navigation.

The consumer arguments of which side is better, and what phones are better regularly leak into our work and quite frankly taint our ability to make great applications for our users. As developers, we are sometimes subject to the whims and biases of designers and product managers. However, we have to take responsibility for ensuring that our mobile products as a whole are enjoyable and consistent for our users. \r\n\r\nAt Monzo, there is a culture of collaboration, which has resulted in the mobile apps becoming closer and closer in feature parity. However, there are still issues, and definitely lessons from the past, which I will detail in this talk. I will also delve into the issues with the more black and white thought processes that plague the industry, what damage they can cause and how much of a detriment to your product they can be. She will then go on to explain how, by working together and appreciating the benefits of both sides, you can ultimately design and build apps that everybody will love, and also be happier in our work.",

It feels like you are being put through an exam. Often, we forget we are also evaluating the company we are interviewing with, especially when we start interviewing for the first time, and it is hard to know what to look for.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, interviewing candidates for a position can be stressful too. You want to find the perfect person to join your team, but there are many factors that feel out of our hands (e.g. rain can affect the mood of the candidate and the person interviewing and impact the result). We need to effectively control the factors that we can.\r\n\r\nWith this talk we want to focus on the whole process of finding the right people to work with, from the job advert to the offer. And we want to do it from both points of view, as the company and as the candidate.\r\n\r\nWe want to show candidates behind the scenes of the interviewing process, to make it feel less intimidating. We want to teach them how to choose a job and a company that fits with them. We want to give some tips on how to prepare for interviews, and the sort of exercises they might encounter.\r\n\r\nWe also want to help companies improve their hiring process. There is no solution that works for everyone, but there are patterns everyone can follow to do better. We want to show them how to reach candidates, make sure qualified candidates apply, show them how to deal with the unavoidable biases they will face, help them understand the pros and cons of different types of  exercises, and finally, help them find the perfect new hire for their team.\r\n\r\nHiring and interviewing is not easy, and there is no easy solution to it. But we hope that with this talk we would make it a little bit better for everyone involved.",

Do you know how some business owners are embarrassed to enter the new market because the software their teams produce is so unstable that itâs frantically just a joke?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, youâll learn how to properly apply practices such as TDD, continuous refactoring, integration, and delivery, get and give feedback on the code, and how you can deploy on Friday evening without fear of being called by your angry CTO to fix broken software over the weekend.",

Minimalism in computing is not a novel idea, it existed back in the 80s when the resources were very expensive and limited.\r\n\r\nNowadays, our software development processes seem to have forgot about it. We deploy entire frameworks, or even entire operating systems, to perform a single task. We include libraries in our projects even when we just need a single method. We create bloated products that cram as much features as we can, rather than focusing on doing one thing right. As well, we have problems focusing at work, we struggle to get things done, and all together our mental health is not improving.\r\n\r\nI believe that is all related, that we should take a step back, simplify, start small, and declutter.\r\n\r\nCome and learn about the principles of minimalism, and how to apply them to your personal and professional life. You will learn about the importance of keeping things simple, learning to focus on the things that matter to make a positive impact in yours, your teamâs and your users' lives.",

What's next?\r\n\r\nI've shared a lot over the last few years about designing for inclusivity and how, as mobile developers, we can add better support for specific groups of users in our apps. One of the questions that I invariably get asked is \"how do I get the rest of my team and company onboard?\"\r\n\r\nLast year, I started working at a fast-paced, rapidly growing startup in the UK. I was really overwhelmed, and I had a hard-enough time getting through my day-to-day work that I felt guilty that I couldn't give the requisite time to make sure my output was accessible. Something had to change and it did.\r\n\r\nThis is a story about what we did to drive inclusive design at our company, and how you can do the same.",

The whole Android framework doesn't give really good support for it and ofter it does not look as smooth as planned.\r\n\r\nLuckily, Google has been working in improving the support for it. Besides the already existing tools, such as Property Animation framework, Layout transitions or Animated Vector Drawables, Google also brought in the ConstraintLayout 2.0, the new MotionLayout.\r\n\r\nWith this layout, animations are made easy and intuitive. In this talk, we will be able to take a brief look at: \r\n1. Basic animation transitions based on Constraints\r\n2. Image transitions\r\n3. How to use keyframes\r\nand\r\n4. How to take advantage of MotionLayout inside the existing layouts",

CoCoS consists of a service, a client library and a command line tool to deliver, read and set up configurations. Configurations are based on a freely defined context sent from the app to the service. This service is comparable to Firebase Remote config but has infinite flexibility and will be open source. \r\n\r\nThis talk gives you an overview of the capabilities of CoCoS and how we use it to make our app remotely configurable in a powerful and easy way.",
